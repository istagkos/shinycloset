Welcome to my personal repo!


The data and scraping/cleaning code in the "MoralJudgementOnReddit" folder are self-contained and ready for use.

All other folders contain code and reports that give a small taste of a few of the projects that I have been involved in. The code is unlikely to run.

Apologies for the inconvenience, it is due to creating this repo long after the completion of most projects.


Have fun!
